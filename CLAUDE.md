# Rockbeat — project guide

Taiko-style rhythm game for Pebble Time 2 (emery), C on Pebble SDK 4.17.

## What this is

| Path | Language | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `watch/` | C | the whole app. All `pebble` commands run from here. |
| `tools/` | C + sh | host-side unit tests, no emulator needed |

## Commands

All from `watch/`; the pebble tool fails elsewhere.

```bash
pebble build
pebble clean                              # needed after editing package.json
pebble install --emulator emery
pebble screenshot --emulator emery --no-open shot.png
pebble emu-button --emulator emery click select
pebble logs --emulator emery
pebble kill
```

From the repo root: `./tools/run_tests.sh` (expect `OK: 1545 checks passed`).

This tool version does **not** accept `--scale`. `--vnc` disables emulator audio.

## Architecture

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `rb_config.h` | every tunable constant, with the reasoning for each |
| `main.c` | window lifecycle, frame timer, the hit path, debug harness |
| `clock.{c,h}` | the only caller of `time_ms()`; monotonic ms accumulator |
| `chart.{c,h}` | chart format, the demo song, forward-compatible loader |
| `game.{c,h}` | song timeline, judgment, score, combo. **No Pebble APIs.** |
| `render.{c,h}` | all drawing. **The only file with `graphics_*` calls.** |
| `input.{c,h}` | raw-click handlers producing timestamped hit events |
| `feedback.{c,h}` | hit-flash state and the haptics drop policy |
| `audio.{c,h}` | PCM voice pool, mixer and pump; the only speaker caller |
| `save.{c,h}` | high score and toggles; the only `persist_*` caller |

## Key constraints & gotchas

- **The song clock is authoritative.** Note x comes from
  `(hit_time_ms - elapsed_ms)`; scoring compares the press timestamp to
  `hit_time_ms`. Audio and haptics are outputs only. Never let the timing loop
  read audio state — that is the property that makes the game immune to speaker
  latency, and it is currently enforced by the module graph, not by discipline.

- **`game.c` and `chart.c` must never include `<pebble.h>`.** That is the only
  reason `tools/run_tests.sh` can compile them with the system `cc`. The moment
  either calls `time_ms()`, `persist_*` or `graphics_*`, the tests stop building.
  This is why `game_judge_hit()` *returns* a judgment rather than firing effects,
  and why `game.c` takes `now_ms` as a parameter instead of reading a clock.

- **`time_ms()` must only ever be used as a delta.** `epoch_seconds * 1000` is
  ~1.78e12 in 2026 and does not fit in any 32-bit type, and the wall clock is not
  monotonic — a phone sync can move it either way mid-song. `clock.c` accumulates
  clamped deltas instead; a backwards step contributes 0 and a forward step is
  capped at `RB_CLOCK_MAX_STEP_MS`.

- **`pebble emu-button` can permanently wedge the emulator's screenshot
  service.** Afterwards every `screenshot` and `emu-button` on that instance
  returns a libpebble2 `TimeoutError` and never recovers — only `pebble kill`
  plus a reinstall does. Screenshots taken before any button press are reliable.
  Hence the debug flags in `rb_config.h`: use `RB_DEBUG_AUTOPLAY` +
  `RB_DEBUG_FREEZE_AT_MS` to reach any frame with zero presses, and
  `RB_DEBUG_LOG_JUDGMENTS` + `pebble logs` to verify real input (logs survive the
  wedge).

- **The emulator's first frames after app launch are hundreds of ms apart.** This
  bit twice: it made a naive "stop stepping past the threshold" freeze overshoot
  by ~600 ms, and it made autoplay lose the opening notes to auto-miss when it ran
  *after* `game_step()`. Autoplay now runs before the step, and the freeze clamps
  the clock reading that both of them consume.

- **A vibration issued while another is ongoing is dropped, not queued**
  (`pebble.h` Vibes doc). Naive one-pulse-per-hit silently loses most buzzes on a
  dense chart. `feedback.c` rate-limits normal pulses and lets only big notes
  cancel an in-flight one.

- **`persist_exists()` returns true for keys this app has never written**, and
  `persist_read_int()` then hands back a stale value. This cost real debugging
  time: the sound toggle read back as 1, which the flag encoding means "off", so
  audio silently never opened even though nothing had ever disabled it.
  `save_load()` therefore writes *every* key explicitly during first-run
  initialisation. Never trust `persist_exists()` as proof a key is unset — and
  keep the +1 flag encoding (1 = false, 2 = true) so a zero is distinguishable.

- **Audio is measured, not assumed.** `RB_DEBUG_LOG_AUDIO` logs the
  `speaker_stream_open` result, the mute/quiet-time state, frame pacing, and any
  short write. On the emulator the stream opens, nothing is muted, and there is
  *zero* backpressure at a 40 ms lead.

- **The emulator's clock runs about twice real time** (~2000 ms of song per
  ~1000 ms of host wall time), with occasional 0 ms and 1000 ms frame deltas. So
  `sleep N` in a capture script does not reliably reach a given point in the
  song; use `RB_DEBUG_FREEZE_AT_MS` instead.

- **The back button cannot take a raw, long, or repeating click handler**
  (`pebble.h:97-98`). Single-click only. Fine here — BACK is never gameplay.

- **`ClickHandler` carries no timestamp.** The press time must be sampled with
  `clock_now_ms()` as the literal first statement of the handler; everything after
  it is latency charged to the player.

- **Guard the speaker with `#if PBL_API_EXISTS(speaker_stream_open)`, never
  `#ifdef PBL_SPEAKER`.** Gabbro declares the real functions but does not get the
  `PBL_SPEAKER` define — an SDK inconsistency.

- **The Gothic system fonts have no arrow glyphs.** Lane badges are drawn as
  stacked `graphics_fill_rect` rows, not `▲`/`▼` characters, which render as tofu.
  No `GPath` either — that would mean a heap allocation.

- **`wscript` is the stock SDK default and byte-identical to the sibling repos —
  never edit it.** It already globs `src/c/**/*.c`, so new source files need no
  build change.

## Conventions

- Static functions are prefixed `prv_`, file-scope state `s_`, public functions
  `<module>_<verb>`, macros `RB_`.
- `#pragma once` in every header, never include guards.
- Fixed-size static arrays only; no `malloc`. Integer maths only; no floats.
- Every tunable lives in `rb_config.h` with a comment explaining the number.
- The frame timer only mutates state and calls `layer_mark_dirty()`; all drawing
  happens in `render_update_proc`.
- Layout is derived from `layer_get_bounds()` at draw time, never hardcoded.
- System fonts only (`FONT_KEY_GOTHIC_*`).
- 2-space indent, K&R braces, braces even on single-statement ifs.

## Verifying a change

```bash
./tools/run_tests.sh                              # judgment logic, no emulator
cd watch && pebble build && pebble install --emulator emery
pebble screenshot --emulator emery --no-open shot.png   # BEFORE any button press
```

For gameplay frames, set `RB_DEBUG_AUTOPLAY 1` and `RB_DEBUG_FREEZE_AT_MS` to the
moment you want, then rebuild — and remember the freeze is in *song* time, so you
must wait that long after install before capturing.

Always read the screenshot back rather than assuming it rendered; emery's display
squashes warm colours together, so a palette choice has to be checked by eye.
